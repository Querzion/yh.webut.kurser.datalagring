InMemoryDatabase, is really good for non-critical databases/actions, 
such as login tokens etc, that would be reset in the case of a server/client restart.

InMemoryDatabases are not to be used in real data situations, 
because as soon as the application goes down, all the data is lost.

It can be a really good thing to use this way of handling databases in cases where you have to test,
the functionalities of an application without the hassle of also re-situating the server databases etc.
